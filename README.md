# Getting Started

This is meant to be a simple repo for my CSS Flexbox presentation, but it uses a variety of technologies I love to use. I'll leave instruction for how to get up and running, as well as links so anything I use so that you can use more. I'd advise that you take your time and just focus on understanding one thing at a time.

This is a Next.js app using Yarn, TypeScript, CSS modules, React Query, and Zod.

First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. You will need at least version 18.17.

Next, make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. You will need at least version 1.22.

Then, clone this repo and run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.

Finally, run `yarn dev` to start the development server. You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
